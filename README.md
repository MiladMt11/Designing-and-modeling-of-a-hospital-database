# Designing-and-modeling-of-a-hospital-database
This repo contains the codes for the project I have done in "Database Systems" course at DTU. A more detailed report of the project is provided [here](https://github.com/MiladMt11/Designing-and-modeling-of-a-hospital-database/blob/7cbb1b657f4873582967e8a8cac5c6efa995f3e2/Project%20Report.pdf).


In this project, a simple database for a hospital is modeled. The database has different tables and entities representing various sections and functionalities of the hospital.
The conceptual design and the entity-relationship diagram are also provided in the report.
